### About

Cobwebs are annoying, fishing is boring, and spiders are creepy. So what do you do when you need string? Just make some!

Cordage allows you to craft string using natural fibrous resources. It adds three shapeless crafting recipes using tallgrass, saplings, or vines, as seen below. This could be useful in skyblock-style maps without Ex Nihilo, or simply as a peaceful alternative to killing spiders in any kind of map.

Cordage uses the tags `minecraft:saplings`, `forge:tallgrass`, and `forge:vines` for recipes, so other mod items which use these tags should work as well.

You can also turn rotten flesh into sinew, which can in turn be made into string.
